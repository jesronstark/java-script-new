// Before ES6(2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope.

// JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.

// ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

//     These two keywords provided Block Scope in JavaScript:




{
    let x = 2;
}
// x can NOT be used here
